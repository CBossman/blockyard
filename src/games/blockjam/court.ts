 * The court, in blocks (a block is a metre): where the floor is, the lines, the two baskets. Shared
 * by the server (the rules, the ball), every screen (the ball, the camera) and the players'
 * movement (a dunk flies to the rim). Nothing here but numbers and a few pure helpers.
 *
 * The court runs along x, from the left basket (x < 0) to the right (x > 0); z is across it, the
 * camera's side at +z. The floor's top is at `FLOOR`. The team going right attacks the right
 * basket (`side` +1), the other the left (-1).
